== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can you generate a sidebar? =

Once the plugin is active, go to Appearance>Sidebars. Only your generated sidebars will display on this page, your theme's sidebars are still active and working, they just don't show because they are not generated by this plugin.

= How do I assign a sidebar to a page or a post? =

Edit the page or post, then scroll down to the section labeled Sidebars. Select the sidebar you wish to see on the page. Dont forget to save the page or post.

= What files do I change in my theme? =

Most themes use a 'sidebar.php' file, but some themes may have multiple sidebar, like a side column, and a footer sidebar. These themes sometimes use 'sidebar2.php' or 'sidebar-footer.php' Its easiest to do a find/replace on all of your theme files.
Find: `dynamic_sidebar()` Replace with: `generated_dynamic_sidebar()` 

= How can I style each sidebar differently using CSS? =

Each widget in the sidebar will have a unique class, based on its title, as well as a generic class common among all widgets in all generated sidebars.


== Screenshots ==
