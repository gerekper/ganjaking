	* Fix:  Adds labels back in.
	* Update:  Adds Radio Buttons as an option when choosing a swatch type.  
	* Update:  Handle AJAX loading of the variations form.  
		Loads product variations via an AJAX call to prevent huge amounts of data being rendered on data attributes for the form tag. 
		Improves the core user experience by enabling and disabling options in default select boxes. WooCommerce core does not do this when it's using AJAX for processing. 
		Uses optimized functions for fast retrieval of variation data.

2016.01.04 - version 2.0.0
	* Change:  Vastly simplify how the script processes available variations and controls the swatches which are available. 
		   This rewrite no longer overrides the variable.php file and therefore no longer needs to have template files.  
		   The same filters which were present in 1.7.1 are available for control of the plugin output.  
		   
		   The main difference is that we link the variation selections to the normal WooCommerce attribute selection drop downs.  
		   By linking them in this way, all inventory controls will use the same behavior as if swatches were not enabled. This also uses
		   all core WooCommerce functions to reset the product image and variation selections.   This will provide better compatibility with 3rd party 
		   plugins which modify how images are displayed.
