If you have tried the demo, you can clearly see how fast and dynamic tables created on **Ninja Tables** Plugin can be. It is an easy and user-friendly WordPress table plugin that comes with the most advanced frontend table styles including, Footables, Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, Symmetric UI, etc.

Ninja Tables is perfect for your product list view. You can make order forms, wholesale WooCommerce products, and product catalogs. Besides, if you want to add pagination, sorting, or filtering to your tables, our table maker can do that for you.

Our table maker is also SEO-friendly, and the search engines can pick all the contents of the table. So if you want to use the table maker for creating a table of contents, list, or other table contents that impact search engines, you can do so with ease.

### A Blazingly Fast WP Table Plugin!
Developer or not, we care about all our users. We know about several free and paid WordPress table plugins that receive complaints over their table's speed and responsiveness. But with Ninja Tables, you will never face any issue with loading or rendering data both on the frontend and backend! The plugin’s backend is built on VueJs and VueRouter as SPA!

That is why our users get a smooth experience of creating tables, configuring settings, adding entries, importing from CSVs, rearranging columns, etc. within a blink of an eye!

The frontend of the table maker is even faster! It uses minimal JS and CSS to load the table, and you can also use AJAX tables to handle thousands of data without affecting the page load!

Another important part is, the CSS and JS files will be loaded only on the page where you add table shortcode. Overall, our technology makes this plugin one of the most responsive WordPress table makers you can grab for free!

### Amazing Editing Environment

We have introduced the finest feature you can ever get for making a table. Ninja Tables plugin comes with a design studio for customizing and styling your WordPress tables.

With our Table Design Studio, you can set colors to the table components or customize anything without even writing a single CSS line. And real time visual changes will also help you make or edit WP tables like a pro!

Is it possible to create automatic responsive tables? Yes, you can visually see how your tables will look like on various devices!

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG2sVd6JMtE&list=PLXpD0vT4thWGRfXfDvLdYbV7sI3LcaPCL&index=4) is a quick view of how you can customize your tables with the Design Studio.

### Create Responsive WordPress Tables
While it’s hard to find a responsive WordPress table plugin for free, we can assure you that Ninja Tables really are responsive!

Yes, we did that critical task of making all the tables automatically responsive for mobile devices by placing in-row expandable areas! You can control which columns you want to show on a specific kind of device from our design studio. The fantastic part is that the search, pagination, sorting, and other features of your WordPress tables will also work on mobile devices!

Don’t believe us? Check out the demo:

<iframe width="611" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3gKtAg6EbA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In version 3.1.0, we’ve also introduced <b>Stackable Table UI</b>, where you can show each row as a list view for mobile and table. Please check screenshot-2.

### Configure Your Tables Easily
Designing table columns and configuring responsive breakpoints is faster than ever with our user-friendly column builder. It lets you rearrange the columns easily, and you can specify the data type for each column like a single-line text, text area, or HTML area where you will get a WYSIWYG HTML editor.

### Exporting and Importing Tables Data
We know how hard it is to type in all the table data if you lose them. Unless your WordPress table maker plugin comes with the export-import feature, you’ll probably have to fill out thousands (or millions!) of table cells manually to complete your table!

Ninja Tables have a surprising feature to help you export and import your tables. You can export the table data into a CSV file or use the JSON format to import later. If you are using a TablePress Plugin / Ultimate Table Plugin / Supsystic Plugin, you can also import the table data to Ninja Tables in just one single click!

**Import From TablePress Plugin**

If you already have tables built with TablePress Plugin, you can quickly transfer the tables with one click per table. We have made the process very easy to enjoy the modern table experience and build your tables in no time.

**Import From Ultimate Tables Plugin**

We also have provisions for moving your tables to Ninja Tables from the Ultimate Tables plugin.
Now You can transfer tables to Ninja Tables by going to Ninja Tables-> Import a Table -> Import From Other WP Table Plugin and select “Ultimate Tables.”
You will see a list of all the tables that you created. You can transfer any table to Ninja Tables with a single click.

**Import From Data Tables Generator By Supsystic Plugin**

Data Tables Generator by Supsystic is another popular WordPress table plugin.
If you were using the Data Tables Generator by Supsystic plugin before and want to move the tables to Ninja Tables, go to Ninja Tables -> Import a Table -> Import From Other WP Table Plugin and select “Data Tables Generator by Supsystic.”

You’ll see a list of all the Supsystic Tables. You can transfer any table to Ninja Tables with a single click.

### What's New on 4.1.0?
Over the past two years of development, we released several updates for Ninja Tables. These include improvements to the existing features and some wonderful additions to help you design tables more effectively.

### Ninja Charts integration
**[Ninja Charts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-charts/)** is a data visualizer plugin that can help you visualize statistics and data through beautiful charts. We have integrated Ninja Tables with Ninja Charts so that you can use your table data to create and display astonishing charts on your website.

Check the video below to learn more about Ninja Charts:

<iframe width="1115" height="627" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIHR3_vNOFM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Search Functionality using special characters
We have improved the search bar of Ninja Tables to help you specify your searches using special characters. The search results will be more accurate and specific using special characters!

### WP Fluent Forms Integration
We have received a lot of messages for integrating **[Fluent Forms,](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluentform/)** with our WordPress table plugin, Ninja Tables. And that’s why we combined Ninja Tables with Fluent Forms so that you can add Fluent Forms entries to your tables effortlessly!

You can watch the following video to know more about this latest feature:

<iframe width="611" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxBrmuhu6yQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Build Any Type of Table
You can build any type of table using Ninja Tables. Our users are already making various types of tables using this responsive table plugin. Such as:

<ul><li>Data Table</li>
<li>Pricing Table</li>
<li>Amazon Affiliate Product Table</li>
<li>Product Comparion Table</li>
<li>Responsive Product Specification Table</li>
<li>Member List Table</li>
<li>Any type of Sortable and Searchable Data Table</li>
<li>Customer List Table</li>
<li>League Points Table</li>
<li>Sports Team Member Table with Image</li>
<li>Any Type of Data that need to be shown as tabular format</li></ul>

### Blazing Fast Frontend Table Rendering
We have optimized this plugin for about 2 years and improved the features significantly. But we did not compromise with page speed. Ninja Tables will only load the scripts and styles on the page where you insert the shortcode. That means your site will not be slow.

Our ajax technique loads thousands of rows without slowing down any WordPress site. The front-end javascript file is less than 4KB (Incredible, right?)

Further improvements to this plugin are underway, so you may contribute by giving us suggestions anytime. Our engineers will get back to you as soon as possible.

### Awesome Support
You can get dedicated support from our excellent happiness managers and developers for this beautiful WordPress table plugin for **free**! All you need to do is create a support ticket from here:  https://wpmanageninja.com/support-tickets/.
