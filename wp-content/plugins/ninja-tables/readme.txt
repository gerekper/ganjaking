### Ninja Table is blazingly fast!
We care about the developers and the users. We know other plugins receive a high amount of complaints about the speed of rendering of the tables. But Ninja Tables never has the issue of loading or rendering data both on frontend and backend! Ninja Table's backend is built on VueJs and VueRouter as SPA! That is the main reason why Ninja tables users get the smooth experience of creating tables, configuring settings, adding entries, importing from CSVs, rearranging columns etc in like less time than a blink of an eye! The frontend of the tables is even faster! We use minimal JS and CSS to load the table while we do have the AJAX with our tables so our tables can handle thousands of data without affecting the page load! Another improtant part is, the css and js files will be loaded only in the page where you add ninja tables shortcode.

### Ninja Tables got an Amazing Editing Environment

We have introduced the finest feature you can ever get for editing a table which is a design studio for customizing and styling your tables with the most realtime visual changes you can see while editing and making your tables! With our Design Studio, you can set colors to the table components or do customize anything without even writing a single line of CSS! If you are worried about the responsiveness of your tables, you can visually see how your tables will look like on various devices from the design studio. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG2sVd6JMtE&list=PLXpD0vT4thWGRfXfDvLdYbV7sI3LcaPCL&index=4) is a quick view of how you can customize your tables with the Design Studio.

### Ninja Tables are responsive
It is hard to believe that we have made all types of tables responsive! Yes, we did that critical task f making all the tables responsive for mobile devices by placing in-row expandable areas! You can control which columns you want to show what kind of device form our design studio. The amazing part is, the searching, paginations, sorting and all other features also work on the mobile devices! Trust me it is tough for the common users! Here is a demo for you.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3gKtAg6EbA]

- By Bob (@shallway)

>__Amazing time saver!__
>This is my Go-To app, after years of fat-fingering updates into a spread spread sheet. And then working to upload the information. Ninja Tables is a time/life saver. Very easy to use. I send my client(s) a spreadsheet, they update their rates and I import/upload these to the site. That’s it. I highly recommend!
- By RTyrell (@rtyrell)

>__Great Plugin, Even Better Support__
>This plugin is easily one of my most used plugins for my website. It is very easy to use and is packed with features. The developers are super quick to respond if you happen to run into any issues. Definitely recommend!

It allows for a great deal of customization.
- By @bronzeego

Many thanks to the support of Ninja table.
- By @alcapone65

>__Best and most flexible WP Tables Plugin__
> We tried a lot of plugins, but “Ninja Tables” was the only one, that fits all our needs. It’s no rocket science to create the first table and fill it up with data. Additionally it is so flexible, that you are able to move and change the table, without having to re-create the whole thing. PS: We’re using now the Pro version and it absolutely worth the price – it’s nearly a steal, for what you get.
