* Fix - Added 'composite_parent' and 'composite_children' keys to WC API order response data, to assist in establishing Composite Products parent/child item relationships.
* Fix - Modified composite parent/child weight and dimension keys in WC API order response data, depending on the "Per-Item Shipping" option state and exact cart package content.

To avoid issues in cart when the "Per-Item Pricing" option is checked, all container cart item properties are set to their base price counterparts when session data is loaded.
* Fix - Handling of composited products in coupons. Coupon validity of composited items is now inherited from their parents - specifically: A coupon cannot be valid for a composited item if the composite that contains it is excluded from the coupon. A coupon will be valid for a composited item if it is valid for the composite that contains it, unless the coupon exclusion rules apply to the composited item itself.
* Fix - PHP warning in order details template when viewing Composites without any Component selections (all Components optional and empty).
* Fix - Remove nonces from front-end ajax requests.
