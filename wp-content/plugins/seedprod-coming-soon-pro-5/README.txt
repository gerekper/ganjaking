= Creating WordPress Landing Pages with SeedProd =

What are landing pages? A landing page is a standalone web page that a person "lands" on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location. Most of the time, these landing pages have a different design from the rest of your site and do not show your website's standard header and footer. 

Landing Pages have a particular purpose and desired user action; therefore, you want them to be distraction-free as possible. With SeedProd, it is super easy to create high-converting landing pages for any purpose, that are entirely separate from your website's design. 

You can use our Domain Mapping feature to put landings page on their own domain, our Dynamic Text feature to add personalization, or our WooCommerce Blocks to build one-off product pages. These are just a few of the many powerful features SeedProd provides.

= Building Coming Soon Pages and Maintenance Mode Pages with SeedProd =

SeedProd allows you to build a coming soon or maintenance mode page that will hide your site from visitors and search engines like Google. You can work on your website in private. When the website uses coming soon mode, the page will be indexed by Google as long as your site is not set to be private in WordPress. 

In Maintenance Mode, we return a 503 header status that lets Google know your site is down for maintenance.

Both of these modes are essential for any WordPress Website to have.

The Free Version of SeedProd comes with a variety of Coming Soon Page and Maintenance Mode templates.
