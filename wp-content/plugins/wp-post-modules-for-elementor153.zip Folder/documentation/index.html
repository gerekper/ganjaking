<h2 id="translating_plugin">Translating the Plugin</h2>

<p>2. Open poEdit software and click on File &gt; New from POT/PO file.</p>
<p>3. Browse the wp-post-modules-el.pot file as located inside plugin's '/languages/' folder. A language popup will appear. Choose your language and click on &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="images/poedit_1.jpg" alt="Choose language"><span class="caption">Choose translation language</span></p>

<p>7. Now you need to define the language inside WordPress settings. For that, log in to WordPress admin and navigate to Settings &gt; General. From the &quot;Site Language&quot;, choose the language in which you have created the PO file. Then save changes.</p>

<h3 id="frequently_asked_questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>Below are some Frequently Asked Questions that may help you in finding a solution to your specific issue.</p>
<h4>1. I have just uploaded the download zip file to WordPress, but it is showing installation error. Why?</h4>
<p>Your download zip file is not the plugin itself. It is a collection of plugin and documentation. It will be required to unzip this folder first. Next look for the folder named <strong>"wp-post-modules-el.zip</strong>". Use this zip folder for uploading the plugin via WordPress. Alternatively, you can download installable plugin file from your CodeCanyon account's downloads section.</p>
<h4>2. How to update the plugin</h4>
<p>Plugin can be updated in two ways:</p>
<p>2.1) <strong>From the WordPress admin</strong>: Navigate to Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins. Deactivate the &quot;WP Post Modules&quot; plugin and delete it. Next, install the latest copy of plugin by browsing the <code>wp-post-modules-el.zip</code> file from your computer.</p>
<p>2.2)<strong> From the FTP or Control Panel</strong>: Log in to your FTP or Control Panel of hosting account and locate the <code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-post-modules-el/</code> folder. Delete this folder and update the latest extracted folder from your computer. This method is safer than the previous one.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After updating the plugin, clear all browser caches and plugin caches (if using a caching plugin).</p>
