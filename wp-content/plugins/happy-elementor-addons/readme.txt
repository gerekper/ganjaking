* **Cross-Domain Copy-Paste:** Apply The Same Design To Multiple Domains With A Single Click:

If you are creating different web pages with WordPress, you will often try to use the same elements of a web page to other pages over and over again. To address this issue, the Elementor page builder comes with a free copy and paste elements feature for a single domain. But the problem is you can not copy and paste an element to other domains.
This is where the goodness of the Happy Addons comes to the rescue! With this tool, you can copy and paste any element (for example, buttons, navigation bars, carousel, accordion, etc.) from one domain to another domain. Cool, right? Don’t miss out on the chance to scale up your working efficiency with the help of a cross-domain copy-paste extension. We are the inventor of the cross-domain copy-paste feature.
