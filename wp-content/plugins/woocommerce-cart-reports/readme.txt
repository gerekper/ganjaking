2. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

3. Activate the plugin  through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Usage ==

Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Cart Reports to verify timeout and time-range settings. Go to Carts to see Open, Abandoned, and Converted Carts. Go to WooCommerce -> Reports -> Carts (Tab) to see an area graph showing store cart breakdown.
