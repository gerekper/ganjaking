== Description ==

WooCommerce Smart Coupons is the most powerful, all in one solution for gift certificates, store credits, discount coupons and vouchers.

Here's what you can do with this plugin:

* Create coupons of a new type - "Store Credit / Gift Certificate". Credit balance will be managed automatically.
* Link any coupon with a product - new or existing. Customers automatically get that coupon when they purchase the product.
* Gift Certificates - create a new product, call it a Gift Certificate / Voucher (or anything else that suits your business). Add details and pricing and associate a "Store Credit / Gift Certificate" coupon with it. Customer will get an option to enter email address of the person to send the coupon to during checkout. They can also add a custom message along.
* Works great with Chained Products plugin - allowing you to create product combos that include other products and gift vouchers for future purchase - increasing the overall value of the offer.
* Buy Gift Certificate / Store Credit of any denomination
* Send Gift Certificate / Store Credit to multiple people
* Automatic coupon generation with prefix / suffix support
* Import coupons in bulk
* Admin can send a store credit / gift certificate to anyone
* Link as many coupons as you want with a product
* Link coupons with any product type - standard, digital, variable etc.
* Automatic Balance Maintenance - As a customer keeps using a credit coupon, balance will keep reducing automatically.
* Automatic Deletion on Zero Balance - When the balance reaches zero, the credit / certificate will be deleted automatically. No need to spend time on this.
* Unique coupon code generation for all credits / gift certificates.
* Tight security - coupons can be associated with customers and credits can be used only by their beneficiaries.
* Unique "Apply Coupon with One Click" technology - logged in customers will see available coupons on the cart / checkout pages and can apply a coupon with single click. No longer digging into mailboxes and time / attention waste during the critical checkout process.
* Offer Credits at a Discount - Link a coupon with any product and set the product's price lower than coupon's value. Offering a discounted gift certificate. We've seen huge increase in sales this way. You get money in advance, and customer keeps coming back to the store to buy more. **In our tests we actually discovered 84% customers bought more than the gift certificate value itself.**
* Carries forward benefits of WooCommerce coupon system: limiting coupons to specific products, validity period, usage times, expiry date etc.
* Can search for coupons issued to a customer by their email address
* Notifies customers about remaining store credit balance in order email
* Can even duplicate an existing coupon
* Same convenient and familiar coupon management interface - no need to learn a new interface to manage Smart Coupons
