= Coupon Configuration =

WooCommerce Free Gift Coupons works very similarly to the other coupon types. Go to WooCommerce &gt; Coupons and click on "Add Coupon" to create a coupon.

Under "General", change "Discount Type" to "Free Gift". An input called "Free Gifts" will appear. Start typing the name of the product that you'd like to give away until WooCommerce recognizes it, then you can select it.

Free Gift coupons follow all the same Usage Restriction and Usage Limits as other Discount Types, such as by email address, minimum cart total, etc. 

When you are done configuring the Coupon, select publish and the Free Gift Coupon will now be active.

= Coupon Redemption =

The coupon can be redeemed exactly like other coupons.  When the customer enters the appropriate code and clicks "Apply Coupon" a small message is displayed saying the code was applied and the free gift is automatically added to the cart.

== FAQ ==

= Can I give a gift if someone buys a certain number of items? For example, buy 9 'widgets' and get one free? =

Currently, no. WooCommerce doesn't yet support usage limitations by item quantity.
